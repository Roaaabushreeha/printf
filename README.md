# ft_printf

**ft_printf** is a custom implementation of the standard `printf` function in C, developed as part of the **42 School Curriculum**.  
The project aims to reproduce the behavior of `printf` with support for format specifiers, flags, and argument handling â€” all without using the standard `printf` function.
